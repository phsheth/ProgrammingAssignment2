#The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

#set the value of the matrix
#get the value of the matrix - Also checks if the matrix is square - if not - it breaks the function execution in cacheSolve
#set the value of the inverse of matrix
#get the value of the inverse of matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  matinv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    matinv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() {
    if((!(nrow(x) == ncol(x))) ==TRUE) {
      message("Matrix is not square")
      break
    } else {
      x
    }
  }
  setinv <- function(solve) matinv <<- solve
  getinv <- function() matinv
  list(setinv = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


#The following function calculates the inverse of the special "vector" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse of matrix has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse of matrix from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  matinv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(matinv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(matinv)
  }

  data <- x$get()
  matinv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(matinv)
  matinv
}
